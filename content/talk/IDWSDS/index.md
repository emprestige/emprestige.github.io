summary: A conference talk given by four womern and non-binary people working in data science
abstract: "In this session, we introduced the newly launched Centre for Data and Statistical Science for Health (DASH Centre) which aims to bring together data science expertise from across the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine’s four sites to generate new opportunities for research, training and impact. We shone a spotlight on the research of four individuals who work with observational health datasets both locally and globally with applications that span infectious and genetic diseases, maternal health, and artificial intelligence. We closed the session with some reflections on inclusion and gender in our academic environment."
