Hello! I'm Em (they/them), I am a PhD student in the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) (CMMID) working with [OpenSAFELY](https://www.opensafely.org/) to uncover disparities in respiratory viruses and vaccine uptake.

I have a number of research outputs you can take a look at, including, [papers](publication/), [talks](talk/), and [projects](project/)! Or scroll down for my recent work.
