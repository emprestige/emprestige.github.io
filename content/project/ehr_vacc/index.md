I am interested in studying vaccine uptake and effectiveness, as well as the impact of vaccine uptake on existing burden of respiratory viruses. One of my current pre-prints I have worked on uses Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to perform vaccine-effectiveness studies. I am also currently working on modelling maternal immunisation uptake across England using EHR data.
